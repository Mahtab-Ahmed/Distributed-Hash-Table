This was a project that I worked on earlier in my CS degree. We were tasked to make a ring DHT using various data structures which included, Cyclic linked list, B tree, and an abstract data type that was able to handle large string values. 
SHA1 was used to generate the hash values of the emulated machines.
This is the complete source code, no other libraries except a C++ compiler are needed to run this project.
